# SearXNG Home Assistant app

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add app repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRog294super%2FHome-Assistant-APP-Searxng)

A Home Assistant OS app that runs the official [**SearXNG**](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) metasearch engine while staying as close as possible to the upstream project.

This app is designed to provide a lightweight, easy-to-maintain integration for Home Assistant users without modifying the core SearXNG application.

## Features

* Uses the official SearXNG Docker image.
* Runs directly on the Home Assistant host network.
* Automatically generates and persists a secure `secret_key`.
* Keeps configuration as close as possible to the upstream defaults.
* Supports enabling and disabling search engines through the Home Assistant configuration.
* Designed for minimal maintenance across future SearXNG releases.

## Design Philosophy

This app intentionally avoids maintaining a full copy of SearXNG's default `settings.yml`.

Instead it uses:

```yaml
use_default_settings: true
```

Only Home Assistant specific settings are generated during startup. This means future SearXNG updates automatically benefit from upstream improvements without requiring large configuration changes inside the app.
